\subsection{Outcome}
Several ideas were presented throughout the meeting at various stages, however
the finances were never specifically addressed. The ideas which cropped up that
could be potential revenue streams:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pancakes
  \item BBQ
  \item Movie Nights with gold coin donation
  \item Class tutorials, workshops and other activities which bear a small
  charge for non-members.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine income and revenue strategies. Past experience tells us we
  cannot rely on MUSRA alone.
\end{itemize}
