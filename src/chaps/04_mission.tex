\section{Mission Statement}
\label{sec:MissionStatement}
\subsection{Outcome}
Carl (predominantly) drafted a mission statement which reads as:\\

\emph{Furthing the enrichment and application of `knack' through a rich variety
of learning, social, and challenging activities for engineering (and like minded)
folk at Macquarie University.}\\
\\
%quote and quotation environments make following indentations look all munted
%todo: maybe fix that, if necessary.
\emph{`knack'} is to be linked to the famous\footnote{infamous?} Dilbert video
wherever possible where the Garbage Man defines \emph{'knack'} to be:\\

\emph{a rare condition characterized by an extreme intuition about all things
mechanical and electrical\ldots and utter social ineptitude.}

\subsection{Action items}
While we are largely happy with the mission statement as is, we are going to
allow ourselves more time to let creative juices mold it a little more (if they
are flowing).\\
\\
Also, peer review the mission statement before finalizing.
